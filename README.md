# Interview Assignments

This repository contains all the files required to complete the Droice Labs technical interview assignments.
Please write, test, and document your code to be clear and understandable (and, where appropriate, as if it were going into production.)

## Assignments

Each candidate should complete **_one_** of the following assignments: 
- **[Data science](https://github.com/droicelabs/interview-assignments/blob/master/docs/DATASCIENCE.md)** 
- **[Deep learning](https://github.com/droicelabs/interview-assignments/blob/master/docs/DEEPLEARNING.md)*** 

## Setup

To set up the environment and run the code for this assignment you can use the following code snippet:

```
git clone https://github.com/droicelabs/interview-assignments.git
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Documentation

With your submission, include a README including the following information:
- Full name and preferred email
- The assignment you chose
- A link to your resume or public profile
- A link to any code (e.g., on Github) that you would like to share
- Answers to open-ended discussion questions (see assignment documentation for more details)
- A discussion of anything that was left incomplete, left out, or what you might do differently if you had more time

Also include the updated assignment notebook used to generate your results (.ipynb file, or a .py file if you prefer) and any other files specified in the assignment instructions. 

## Submission Guidelines

Submit a zip archive containing all the files you would like to submit. The name of the file should be \<your_first_name\>\_droicelabs.zip. Email it to the person who sent the challenge to you.

## Evaluation criteria

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

- **Clarity:** Is the code clearly written and easy to understand? Is the reasoning behind decisions clear and documented in the README?
- **Correctness:** Are the tasks in the assignment completed correctly? If there are any issues, is there a discussion in the README?
- **Code quality:** Is the code easy to understand and maintainable? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
- **Technical choices:** Are the choices of tools, libraries, functions, data structures, etc., appropriate for the chosen application?

*The deep learning assignment requires the use of Tensorflow with GPU support

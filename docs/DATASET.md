# Dataset

The dataset **_D_** used in this assignment consists of 60,000 samples of time series data. 
Each data point *x<sub>i</sub>* in **_D_** has a fixed length of 457. 
Additionally, each data point *x<sub>i</sub>* is assigned a class *c*, where *c<sub>i</sub>* is one of ten classes in [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. 

The dataset has been split into two parts: 
 1. A **clean** dataset **_D<sub>clean</sub>_**
    - Contains the first half of the dataset (30,000 data points, indices 1 - 30,000)
    - Each data point *x<sub>i</sub>* contains the full time series of length 457 and the label is provided

 2. A **corrupted** dataset **_D<sub>corrupt</sub>_**
    - Contains the second half of the dataset (30,000 data points without overlap in **_D<sub>clean</sub>_**, indices 30,001 - 60,000)
    - Each data point *x<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup>* contains a random segment extracted from the original time series of length 457 (*x<sub>i</sub>*)
    - Each data point is assigned a class *c* in [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], which is not provided
    - The corrupted data is stored in matrix format; the end of each sequence *x<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup>* has been padded with zeros, and **_D<sub>corrupt</sub>_** contains the window size of each sequence.

An example showing how the corrupted data was generated is shown below:

Each corrupted sample *x<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup>* was generated by selecting a window of variable length from the corresponding clean sample *x<sub>i</sub>* (highlighted in orange).
